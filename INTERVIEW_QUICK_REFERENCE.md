## ❓ FAQ - Quick Answers

### What was the hardest problem you solved?
**A**: The pause/resume functionality with persistent state. It required coordinating frontend localStorage, backend break time tracking, and real-time calculations to ensure accurate time tracking across refreshes and logouts.

### How did you handle real-time updates?
**A**: Socket.IO for bidirectional communication. Backend emits events (e.g., `attendance:day-started`), all connected clients listen and update UI instantly. Managed Socket connection via React Context API.

### Tell me about the AI integration.
**A**: Integrated Google Gemini AI for productivity scoring and admin chatbot. For chatbot accuracy, I reduced temperature to 0.3, injected structured real-time data into prompts, and increased token limits. Used OCR (Tesseract.js) for screen content analysis.

### Performance optimizations?
**A**: 
- Delta-based screen capture (70% storage reduction)
- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Optimistic UI updates
- Efficient MongoDB aggregations with proper indexes
- LocalStorage for caching

### Security measures?
**A**: JWT authentication, Role-based access control (RBAC), Password hashing (bcrypt), API route protection middleware, Input validation (frontend + backend), Environment variables for secrets, Audit logging for compliance

### Database design decisions?
**A**: MongoDB with Mongoose. Used ObjectId references for relationships, strategic indexes on frequently queried fields, schema validation, aggregation pipelines for complex queries, 25+ models with clear separation.
